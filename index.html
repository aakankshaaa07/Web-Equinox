                <p>As the fire broke out, it was clear that the apocalypse was upon us. All at once, the lush green lands of the world were no more than ash and charcoal. The air was heavy with the smell of burnt flesh, and smoke hung in a haze that partially obscured the blood-red sun. The cities stood like skeletons, barren wastelands, empty now that disease had taken whatever the fire did not. Even the oceans stood still like semi-stagnant pools of death and decay. There were no waves as even the wind had left the earth. The skies were barren, no birds flew or sang, And all the while the oppressive heat rained down like the breath of hell. A colossal monochromatic canvas, that was what our planet was reduced to—a remembrance of a fallen era. An era of men, as we called ourselves. Beings of the earth, or so we claimed; even we couldn't stop the apocalypse.</p>

                <p>We were just ten people. Ten survivors. We thought it was the end of the human race; we had perished. But we recovered seven pods in the next five days. There was hope— a hope that it was not the end for us. Our planet had burned, burned to its extinction, but we were alive. We don’t know how many of us made it. We don’t know how many can survive the new environment. But we have hope, and it’s enough. We have a dream; a dream to rebuild Olympus. The mythical home of the gods in Greek mythology. Created after the Titanomachy, the epic battle between the young gods, the Olympians and the older gods, the Titans. As a result of this battle, the Olympian victors created their new majestic home – Mount Olympus. It was shrouded from human eyes by clouds which constantly obscured its peaks. This is our new home, all hail Olympus!</p>

            <p>We are glad that you had a successful rescue mission from Earth. Welcome to the colony we've made in space, Olympus. Our ancestors always said that Rome wasn't built in a day, but we are trying to build our community as fast as we can. We are looking for survivors, and we always will. Olympus is small yet harmonious; this is our and your new family. Gaming, that's the primary source of income. People here spend most of their times in small arcades that we built or at their homes indulging in physical and video games. You now own a virtual wallet that has been credited with 1000 drachma coins. We expect you to spend those coins wisely on games that are your forte. We will credit more drachma coins in your wallet after you complete your quests and win games. We wish you all the best! Welcome to Olympus. I hope you find your Guild.</p>
